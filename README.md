# PythonPilot
Re-implement the Phase One Capture Pilot HTTP Interface in Python

Supports Getting and setting different parameters (Shutter Speed, ISO, File Format, etc.) from any IQ series back with Wifi. 
Supports a low level async functional API 
Supports a simple object based interface to a DB as well. 

##Usage

TODO

## Future Goals

* Multi-platform app via kivy
* Support Image downloading
* Support modifying more settings/Different objects other than the DB that the CapturePilot server normally supports
* But pre built apps on app store to support older IQ backs as CapturePilot is now no longer developed.
